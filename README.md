# 🚢 Titanic Survival Predictor 

This is an interactive web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a Titanic passenger would survive or not, based on input features like age, fare, sex, and class. The model uses classic **Machine learning** algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
